Olist is an e-commerce platform that connects small business to major marketplaces in brazil.
However, many potential customers drop off various stages of the sales funnel, leading to lost revenue opportunities.

The goal of this project is to analyze the Olist sales funnel, identifying bottlenecks where leads drop off,
and provide insights tp optimize conversion rates.

By leveraging Python we will visualize the sales pipeline, track key metrics, suggest data-driven
strategies to improve customer acquisition and sales performance.

Project Objective:
Analyze the end-to-end sales funnel for Olist—from marketing leads to order delivery—to identify conversion gaps, 
performance drivers, and operational bottlenecks.
