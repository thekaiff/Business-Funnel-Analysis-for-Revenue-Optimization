    "“In this project, I performed a complete end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis on four interconnected datasets — leads, marketing-qualified leads (MQL), products, and orders — to prepare them for a funnel analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started with a full data quality assessment: checking row counts, missing values, duplicate entries, and overall schema consistency across datasets. After identifying anomalies, I applied targeted cleaning steps — such as validating categorical variables, handling invalid entries (e.g., recategorizing unexpected values in lead_behaviour_profile), imputing missing values using statistical methods like mode, and dropping non-informative or redundant columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also standardized boolean fields, removed irrelevant features, and ensured consistent formatting across datasets. To confirm data reliability, I generated duplicate summaries and cross-validated row counts across all tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the EDA, I had a clean, structured, analysis-ready dataset that accurately reflects user behavior across the customer journey. This foundation sets up a reliable base for conducting actionable funnel analysis and deriving business insights"
